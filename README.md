# airbnb-clone-project

üöÄ Objective
The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.

üèÜ Project Goals

User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## üßë Database Design

### Users
The `users` entity will include:
- `user_id` (Primary Key)
- `name`
- `sex`
- `email_address` (Unique)
- `password`
- `created_at`
- `account_status` (e.g., `'active'`, `'inactive'`, `'banned'`) ‚Äî *optional, for user management*

**Relationships:**
- One user can create many properties (1:N)
- One user can make many bookings (1:N)
- One user can leave many reviews, only after booking and payment (business logic)

---

### Properties
The `properties` entity will include:
- `property_id` (Primary Key)
- `location`
- `price`
- `availability` (`available_from` to `available_to`)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
- `property_status` (e.g., `'active'`, `'inactive'`, `'suspended'`) ‚Äî *optional, to control listing visibility*

**Relationships:**
- One property can have many bookings (1:N), but bookings must not overlap in time (conflict validation required)
- One property can have many reviews (1:N)
- One property can have many associated payments through bookings

---

### Bookings
The `bookings` entity will include:
- `booking_id` (Primary Key)
- `booking_date`
- `payment_made` (Boolean or status flag)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key to Properties)
- `start_date`
- `end_date`
- `booking_status` (e.g., `'pending'`, `'confirmed'`, `'cancelled'`, `'completed'`) ‚Äî *tracks progress of each booking*

**Relationships:**
- Each booking is for one property (N:1)
- Each booking is made by one user (N:1)
- Each booking has one payment (1:1)

---

### Reviews
The `reviews` entity will include:
- `review_id` (Primary Key)
- `title`
- `message`
- `ratings`
- `review_date`
- `user_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key to Properties)

**Relationships:**
- One property can have many reviews (1:N)
- One user can write many reviews (1:N), only after a valid, paid booking (business logic)

---

### Payments
The `payments` entity will include:
- `payment_id` (Primary Key)
- `booking_id` (Foreign Key to Bookings)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
- `payment_date`
- `amount`
- `payment_mode` (e.g., `'card'`, `'bank_transfer'`)
- `payment_status` (e.g., `'pending'`, `'successful'`, `'failed'`, `'refunded'`) ‚Äî *helps track payment issues*

**Relationships:**
- One user can make multiple payments for different bookings (1:N)
- Each booking has exactly one payment (1:1)


üî† API Security

Authentication. to verify if the user is who they claim to be. Use secure login with hashed passwords (e.g., bcrypt), Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or session-based authentication and Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA) in the future

Authorization: to control what action a user can carry out. Implementation through Enforce role-based access control (RBAC) (e.g., guest, host, admin), Only allow hosts to create/edit properties and Only allow users to review properties they‚Äôve booked and paid for

Rate Limiting
Purpose: To prevent abuse, spamming, or brute-force attacks.
Implementation: Limit login attempts per IP (e.g., max 5 per minute), Throttle booking or review creation requests and Use tools like Express-rate-limit (Node.js) or middleware in Django/Flask

Data Validation & Sanitization
Purpose: To protect against injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
Implementation: Validate input on both frontend and backend, Escape or sanitize any user input before saving or displaying and Use ORM tools (e.g., Sequelize, Prisma, Django ORM) to avoid raw queries

HTTPS Everywhere
Purpose: To encrypt data in transit.
Implementation: Enforce HTTPS using SSL/TLS certificates, Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS

Password Security
Purpose: To protect user credentials.
Implementation: Store passwords using strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2), Enforce password strength rules and Never store plain-text passwords

Secure Payments Handling
Purpose:To protect financial data and prevent fraud.
Implementation: Use third-party payment processors like Stripe or Paystack, Never store raw card details and Validate payment responses using secure callbacks (webhooks)

Database Access Controls
Purpose:To prevent unauthorized data access.
Implementation: Use environment-based credentials (never hard-code passwords), Restrict database access by IP or role and Back up data securely and regularly

Logging & Monitoring 
Purpose: To detect and investigate security incidents.
Implementation: Log user activities (e.g., logins, failed payments), Monitor for unusual patterns (e.g., excessive login attempts), Alert admins when suspicious activity occurs

protecting user data can lead to reputational damage, can impersonates users or hosts, violation of data protection laws
securing payments a breach can lead to finacial theft, fraudlent transactions and legal liablility for loss of customer funds
Reviews influence trust and decision without protection user could spam and manipulate reviews, fake reviews will misled customers and host could be harm

üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

**CI/CD** stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment/Delivery**. It is a development practice that automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code. The goal is to make releasing software faster, safer, and more reliable.

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** Every time a developer pushes code, it is automatically tested and integrated into the shared repository. This helps catch bugs early.
- **Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD):** Code that passes all tests is automatically deployed to staging or production environments, reducing manual work and deployment errors.

### Why It's Important for This Project

- üö® **Prevents breaking changes** by testing code before it's merged.
- üöÄ **Speeds up development** by automating repetitive tasks like builds and tests.
- üîê **Improves security** by enforcing consistency and automated checks.
- ‚úÖ **Ensures reliability** of every new feature and update.
- üì¶ **Enables faster releases** to users with confidence.

### Tools We Could Use

- **GitHub Actions** ‚Äì For automating tests, linting, and deployment steps on every push or pull request.
- **Docker** ‚Äì To containerize the app, making it easy to run consistently across environments.
- **Heroku / Render / Vercel / AWS** ‚Äì For automatic deployment of the app to a live server.
- **PostgreSQL / MySQL (hosted)** ‚Äì As the production database in deployment workflows.

This setup ensures our Airbnb-style application is always tested, deployable, and production-ready.
