# airbnb-clone-project

üöÄ Objective
The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.

üèÜ Project Goals

User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

üõ†Ô∏è Features breakdown

1. API Documentation
OpenAPI Standard: The backend APIs are documented using the OpenAPI standard to ensure clarity and ease of integration.
Django REST Framework: Provides a comprehensive RESTful API for handling CRUD operations on user and property data.
GraphQL: Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.
2. User Authentication and Authorization
   ensure that only log in user can make bookings and authorization for only those that authorization to view
   and make adjustment to object in database
Endpoints: /users/, /users/{user_id}/
Features: Register new users, authenticate, and manage user profiles.
4. Property Management
   ensure only user with guest role can place properties on the platform and make edit
Endpoints: /properties/, /properties/{property_id}/
Features: Create, update, retrieve, and delete property listings.

6. Booking System
   ensure only register user can make bookings
Endpoints: /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/
Features: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.

8. Payment Processing

10. Review System
    only paid user can make a review
Endpoints: /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/
Features: Post and manage reviews for properties.

12. Database Optimizations
Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.

## üßë Database Design

### Users
The `users` entity will include:
- `user_id` (Primary Key)
- `name`
- `sex`
- `email_address` (Unique)
- `password`
- `created_at`
- `account_status` (e.g., `'active'`, `'inactive'`, `'banned'`) ‚Äî *optional, for user management*

**Relationships:**
- One user can create many properties (1:N)
- One user can make many bookings (1:N)
- One user can leave many reviews, only after booking and payment (business logic)

---

### Properties
The `properties` entity will include:
- `property_id` (Primary Key)
- `location`
- `price`
- `availability` (`available_from` to `available_to`)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
- `property_status` (e.g., `'active'`, `'inactive'`, `'suspended'`) ‚Äî *optional, to control listing visibility*

**Relationships:**
- One property can have many bookings (1:N), but bookings must not overlap in time (conflict validation required)
- One property can have many reviews (1:N)
- One property can have many associated payments through bookings

---

### Bookings
The `bookings` entity will include:
- `booking_id` (Primary Key)
- `booking_date`
- `payment_made` (Boolean or status flag)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key to Properties)
- `start_date`
- `end_date`
- `booking_status` (e.g., `'pending'`, `'confirmed'`, `'cancelled'`, `'completed'`) ‚Äî *tracks progress of each booking*

**Relationships:**
- Each booking is for one property (N:1)
- Each booking is made by one user (N:1)
- Each booking has one payment (1:1)

---

### Reviews
The `reviews` entity will include:
- `review_id` (Primary Key)
- `title`
- `message`
- `ratings`
- `review_date`
- `user_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key to Properties)

**Relationships:**
- One property can have many reviews (1:N)
- One user can write many reviews (1:N), only after a valid, paid booking (business logic)

---

### Payments
The `payments` entity will include:
- `payment_id` (Primary Key)
- `booking_id` (Foreign Key to Bookings)
- `user_id` (Foreign Key to Users)
- `payment_date`
- `amount`
- `payment_mode` (e.g., `'card'`, `'bank_transfer'`)
- `payment_status` (e.g., `'pending'`, `'successful'`, `'failed'`, `'refunded'`) ‚Äî *helps track payment issues*

**Relationships:**
- One user can make multiple payments for different bookings (1:N)
- Each booking has exactly one payment (1:1)
